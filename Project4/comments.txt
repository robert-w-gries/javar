THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
--------------------------------

- Implement symbol table
    - Maps identifiers (strings) to Types
    - should implement the methods the Brylow told us to make
- print visitor
    - copy prints for Absyn classes from Absyn.PrintVisitor to new PrintVisitor
    - add logic for printing Types after every declaration in the AST
- TypeChecker
    - 3 passes, 2 symbol tables, 1 winner
