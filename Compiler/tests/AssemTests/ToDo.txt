    Similar to the LinearSearch problem
    Problem with NotExpr

BinaryTree
    Shorter Version => brokenClassMethods
    Same problem as LinkedList
    Problem with NotExpr

LinearSearch
    Doesn't produce correct output
    Confirmed as a Translate problem

QuickSort
    Doesn't produce correct output
    Confirmed Translate problem
    Problem with NotExpr

Working Brylow Testcases
------------------------
NQueens
BubbleSort
Factorial
Parse1
ThreadGood

Possible issues
---------------

    Array Expressions aren't parsed correctly by reference impl.
    We handle Parse1 correctly but reference doesn't
