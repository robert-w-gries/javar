THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
--------------------------------

- Arrays not implemented properly
    - code:  int[] a = new int[22];
    - output: Encountered "[" at line 5, column 26.  Was expecting "("

- We need to make it so that only certain kinds of expressions can be on the left side of an assignment statement
    - we have started this by only allowing single identifiers, but the following are also allowed:
        - field expressions
        - array expressions
