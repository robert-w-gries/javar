THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
--------------------------------

- While loops result in IndexOutOfBoundsException
    - code:  while (a == b) { a = 0 }
    - suggestion:  ast.body is a stmt object instead of a BlockStmt?

- field expressions with array does not work
    - code:  int b = this.a[22] == 0;
