THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
--------------------------------

- Arrays not implemented properly
    - code:  int[] a = new int[22];
    - output: Encountered "[" at line 5, column 26.  Was expecting "("

- CallExpr is being set to FieldExpr instead
    - code:  a = this.test(1, 2);
    - output: FieldExpr()

- Cannot have multiple division signs in a row
    - code:  int z = a/b/c;
    - output:  Was expecting one of:
                   "[" ...
                   "-" ...
                   "+" ...
                   "<" ...
                   ">" ...
                   "==" ...
                   "!=" ...
                   "&&" ...
                   "||" ...
                   ";" ...
                   "[" ...
